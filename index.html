        <h1>My Favorite Hobby</h1>
        <h2>Solving Math Problems</h2>
        <p>My favorite hobby is solving math problems. Solving math problems helps me think about things and gives me  a challenge! Math also helps me calm down. Math can also help in the real world with a lot of things. For example, if you were to go to a store and the cashier gives you the change and you don't want to get scammed you can use math in this situation. First you have to subract the amount that you had to pay from the amount that you paid. Lets say you paid 12 dollars, but you had to pay $11.20. You would have to do 12-11.20. This is equal to 80. If the cashier gave you 80 cents then the cashier gave all the change. This is some of the many reasons why I like to solve math equations in my free time.</p>
